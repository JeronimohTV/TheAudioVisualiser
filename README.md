I am in the process of creating an Audio Visualiser with the intent of listening for any audio that is coming from the desktop and showing activity in the form of an animated graph, spectrometer or frequency analyser.
I will first start by making sure I can hear the audio.
I will then determine what kind of data I can read from the auido.
I will then determine how to create animations using that data.
